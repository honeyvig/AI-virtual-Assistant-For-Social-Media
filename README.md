# AI-virtual-Assistant-For-Social-Media
To build a virtual assistant for social media content creation, particularly focused on AI content, reels, stories, and managing real estate agent profiles, you can leverage Python, AI tools, and relevant libraries. This virtual assistant will automate key tasks like creating video reels, posts, and stories, as well as handling content generation based on specific themes like real estate and real estate agents.
Key Features of the Virtual Assistant:

    AI Content Creation: Generate content for social media posts, stories, and video reels.
    Video Reel Creation: Automatically create short-form video content (reels) using images, text overlays, and AI-generated scripts.
    Real Estate Profile Management: Generate personalized social media content for real estate agents, such as property highlights, new listings, client testimonials, etc.
    Social Media Post Automation: Automate the scheduling and posting of content on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.

Tools & Libraries Used:

    OpenAI API (for text generation): Generate content ideas, descriptions, captions, etc.
    MoviePy: To create video reels.
    Pillow: To manipulate images for stories and posts.
    Selenium/Instabot: To automate social media posts and interactions.
    FFmpeg: For video editing and rendering.
    Google Text-to-Speech: For adding voiceovers to the reels.
    SpeechRecognition: For voice-to-text (if needed).
    Instagram API: To automate posting on Instagram.
    TikTok API: To post on TikTok (via unofficial API or bot-based automation).

Step 1: AI Content Generation with OpenAI (GPT-3 or GPT-4)

We can use OpenAIâ€™s GPT API to generate captions, social media posts, or even scripts for video reels.
Example for AI Content Generation:

import openai

# Initialize OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

def generate_post_content(prompt):
    """Generate content for social media posts using GPT-3."""
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use "gpt-4" or other available models
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    content = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return content

# Example usage
prompt = "Write an engaging Instagram post for a new luxury property listing in Miami."
content = generate_post_content(prompt)
print(content)

Step 2: Create Video Reels (Using MoviePy)

You can use MoviePy to create video content, such as short reels or stories, by combining images, text, and voiceovers. Here's an example:
Example for Video Reel Creation:

from moviepy.editor import *
from gtts import gTTS
import os

def create_video_reel(images, text_overlay, audio_text, output_file='reel.mp4'):
    """Create a short video reel from images, text overlay, and voiceover."""
    clips = []

    # Convert text to speech
    tts = gTTS(text_overlay, lang='en')
    audio_file = 'audio.mp3'
    tts.save(audio_file)

    # Create image clips with text overlay
    for img_path in images:
        img_clip = ImageClip(img_path, duration=2)  # 2 seconds per image
        img_clip = img_clip.set_position('center')
        img_clip = img_clip.set_fps(24)
        clips.append(img_clip)

    # Concatenate image clips
    video = concatenate_videoclips(clips, method="compose")

    # Add audio to the video
    audio = AudioFileClip(audio_file)
    video = video.set_audio(audio)

    # Write final output
    video.write_videofile(output_file, codec='libx264', fps=24)

    # Clean up
    os.remove(audio_file)
    print(f"Video created and saved as {output_file}")

# Example usage
images = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']  # Your image paths
text_overlay = "Check out this amazing property in the heart of Miami!"
audio_text = "This is a new luxury property in Miami, with incredible amenities and a stunning view."
create_video_reel(images, text_overlay, audio_text)

Step 3: Automate Social Media Posting (Using Selenium for Instagram)

You can automate posting to Instagram using Selenium or Instabot.
Example for Instagram Automation (Posting an Image):

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

def instagram_login(driver, username, password):
    driver.get("https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/")
    time.sleep(3)

    # Find and fill username and password
    driver.find_element(By.NAME, "username").send_keys(username)
    driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password").send_keys(password)
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit']").click()
    time.sleep(5)

def post_image(driver, image_path, caption):
    driver.get("https://www.instagram.com/")
    time.sleep(3)

    # Click on the new post button
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@aria-label='New Post']").click()
    time.sleep(2)

    # Select the image to post
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//input[@type='file']").send_keys(image_path)
    time.sleep(2)

    # Enter the caption
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//textarea[@aria-label='Write a caption...']").send_keys(caption)
    time.sleep(2)

    # Post the image
    driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[text()='Share']").click()
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Image posted successfully!")

# Example usage
driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Use the appropriate driver
instagram_login(driver, "your_username", "your_password")
post_image(driver, "path_to_your_image.jpg", "Check out this amazing new listing!")

Step 4: Automate Content Scheduling (Optional)

You can automate the scheduling of posts using tools like Python's schedule library or APScheduler.
Example using schedule:

import schedule
import time

def create_and_post_content():
    # Generate content, create video, and post
    post_content = generate_post_content("Write an engaging post about a new real estate listing in New York.")
    create_video_reel(images=['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg'], text_overlay=post_content, audio_text=post_content)
    # Automatically post to Instagram or TikTok here

# Schedule daily content creation at 9 AM
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(create_and_post_content)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)  # wait one minute before checking again

Step 5: Connect to the Real Estate Agent Profiles

To manage real estate agents' profiles, you can integrate a simple database (like SQLite or MongoDB) to store their information, listings, and social media posts. Each agent's profile could have associated posts, stories, and video content.
Example for Agent Profile Management (using SQLite):

import sqlite3

def create_agent_profile(agent_name, contact_info):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('real_estate.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS agents (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT,
            contact_info TEXT
        )
    ''')
    c.execute('INSERT INTO agents (name, contact_info) VALUES (?, ?)', (agent_name, contact_info))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Example usage
create_agent_profile("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
